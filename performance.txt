This is the file which lists the comparison between Task 2 and Task 3 of Hadoop and Task 1 and Task 2 of Spark.

NOTE: All operations were run on the local machine for both Hadoop and Spark(standalone mode).

Local Machine Configurations:
OS: Windows 10
RAM: 8 GB
Hard disk: 512 GB
Processor: 1.8 GHz


Time measurement methodology: 

I used the time given on the output screen of both Hadoop and Spark to calculate the total time taken for 
a) getting the input, 
b) map and reduce functions and,
c) writing results to the output directory.

The time were then added to arrive at the total time taken by the program. Given below are the results for both Hadoop and Spark tasks. 
Usually, we see that Spark is much faster than Hadoop for both tasks.

Time Comparisons Results :

1) For task 2 (Hadoop) and task 1 (Spark):

	i) Total Time taken for Task 2(Hadoop): 7.166 seconds
	ii) Total Time taken for Task 1(Spark): 1.456 seconds

2) For task 3 (Hadoop) and task 2 (Spark): 

	i) Total Time taken for Task 3(Hadoop): 6.86 seconds
	ii) Total Time taken for Task 2(Spark): 1.125 seconds
